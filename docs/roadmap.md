## Spec implementation tracking

The C# SDK tracks implementation of MCP spec components using the [modelcontextprotocol project boards](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects?query=is%3Aopen), with a dedicated project board for each spec revision. See the [2026-07-28 spec revision board](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/41/views/1).

## Current focus areas

### Next spec revision

The C# SDK's standing plan is to release support for each new MCP specification revision alongside the specification, as it did for the 2026-07-28 revision. Accepted SEPs are tracked on the revision's project board throughout development so implementation is ready when the revision is published. The next revision is being developed in the [protocol repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol).

### Feedback and end-to-end scenarios

The C# SDK team is actively responding to feedback and continuing to explore end-to-end scenarios for opportunities to add more APIs that implement common patterns.

After the 2.0.0 stable release that aligns with the 2026-07-28 specification version, we will turn our focus to the collection of [`area-auth` issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aarea-auth). End-to-end auth experiences and integration with various auth servers have stood out as a theme of feedback that we aim to address in minor versions within [the 2.x milestone](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/milestone/9).

## Milestones

See the [milestones page](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/milestones) to see which issues and features are being planned for future versions.

## Versioning

For more information about the C# SDK's approach to versioning, breaking changes, and support, see the [Versioning](versioning.md) documentation.
