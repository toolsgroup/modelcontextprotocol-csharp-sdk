## Transports

MCP uses a [transport layer] to handle the communication between clients and servers. Three transport mechanisms are supported: [**stdio**](#stdio-transport), [**Streamable HTTP**](#streamable-http-transport), and [**SSE**](#sse-transport-legacy) (Server-Sent Events, legacy).

[transport layer]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports

### stdio transport

The stdio transport communicates over standard input and output streams. It is best suited for local integrations, as the MCP server runs as a child process of the client.

#### stdio client

Use <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.StdioClientTransport> to launch a server process and communicate over its stdin/stdout. This example connects to the [NuGet MCP Server]:

[NuGet MCP Server]: https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/concepts/nuget-mcp-server

```csharp
var transport = new StdioClientTransport(new StdioClientTransportOptions
{
    Command = "dnx",
    Arguments = ["NuGet.Mcp.Server"],
    ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)
});

await using var client = await McpClient.CreateAsync(transport);
```

The following table describes the key <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.StdioClientTransportOptions> properties:

| Property           | Description                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Command`          | The executable to launch (required)      |
| `Arguments`        | Command-line arguments for the process   |
| `WorkingDirectory` | Working directory for the server process |
| `EnvironmentVariables` | Environment variables (merged with current when inheriting; `null` values remove variables) |
| `InheritEnvironmentVariables` | Whether the server process inherits the current process's environment variables (default: `true`) |
| `ShutdownTimeout` | Graceful shutdown timeout (default: 5 seconds) |
| `StandardErrorLines` | Callback for stderr output from the server process |
| `Name` | Optional transport identifier for logging |

#### Environment variable inheritance

By default, the server process inherits **all** environment variables from the current process. This includes credentials, tokens, proxy settings, and internal configuration that might be sensitive or irrelevant to the server. When running third-party or untrusted MCP servers, consider disabling inheritance to prevent unintentional credential leakage:

```csharp
var transport = new StdioClientTransport(new StdioClientTransportOptions
{
    Command = "my-mcp-server",
    InheritEnvironmentVariables = false,
    EnvironmentVariables = StdioClientTransportOptions.GetDefaultEnvironmentVariables(),
});
```

`GetDefaultEnvironmentVariables()` returns a curated set of environment variables (such as `PATH`, `HOME`, and standard system directories) that most child processes need to start correctly, without leaking credentials or other sensitive values from the parent process. The allowlist is aligned with the defaults used by the TypeScript and Python MCP SDKs. On Windows it also includes `PATHEXT`, which is required for the OS to recognize `.cmd` and `.bat` files as executable. You can add server-specific variables on top:

```csharp
var env = StdioClientTransportOptions.GetDefaultEnvironmentVariables();
env["MY_SERVER_API_KEY"] = apiKey;

var transport = new StdioClientTransport(new StdioClientTransportOptions
{
    Command = "my-mcp-server",
    InheritEnvironmentVariables = false,
    EnvironmentVariables = env,
});
```

If you need to selectively forward a specific set of variables from the parent environment rather than using the curated allowlist, build the dictionary manually:

```csharp
var env = new Dictionary<string, string?>();
foreach (var name in new[] { "PATH", "HOME", "HTTP_PROXY", "HTTPS_PROXY" })
{
    var value = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(name);
    if (value is not null)
        env[name] = value;
}

var transport = new StdioClientTransport(new StdioClientTransportOptions
{
    Command = "my-mcp-server",
    InheritEnvironmentVariables = false,
    EnvironmentVariables = env,
});
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Security risk (inheriting):** Variables such as `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and similar credentials present in the parent process automatically flow into the child process unless inheritance is disabled. This can unintentionally expose sensitive values to third-party or untrusted MCP servers.
>
> **Compatibility risk (not inheriting):** Disabling inheritance can cause the child process to fail to start or behave incorrectly if it relies on variables provided by the OS or shell. `GetDefaultEnvironmentVariables()` covers the most common requirements — `PATH`, `HOME`, and standard system directories — so for most servers it's a safe starting point. For servers that need additional variables not in the default set (such as `DOTNET_ROOT`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `JAVA_HOME`, or proxy settings like `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`), add them on top as shown in the previous example.

#### stdio server

Use <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Server.StdioServerTransport> for servers that communicate over stdin/stdout:

```csharp
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddMcpServer()
    .WithStdioServerTransport()
    .WithTools<MyTools>();

await builder.Build().RunAsync();
```

### Streamable HTTP transport

The [Streamable HTTP] transport uses HTTP for bidirectional communication with optional streaming. This is the recommended transport for remote servers.

[Streamable HTTP]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports#streamable-http

#### Streamable HTTP client

Use <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.HttpClientTransport> with <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.HttpTransportMode.StreamableHttp>:

```csharp
var transport = new HttpClientTransport(new HttpClientTransportOptions
{
    Endpoint = new Uri("https://my-mcp-server.example.com/mcp"),
    TransportMode = HttpTransportMode.StreamableHttp,
    ConnectionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
    AdditionalHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        ["X-Custom-Header"] = "value"
    }
});

await using var client = await McpClient.CreateAsync(transport);
```

The client also supports automatic transport detection with <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.HttpTransportMode.AutoDetect> (the default), which tries Streamable HTTP first and falls back to SSE if the server does not support it:

```csharp
var transport = new HttpClientTransport(new HttpClientTransportOptions
{
    Endpoint = new Uri("https://my-mcp-server.example.com/mcp"),
    // TransportMode defaults to AutoDetect
});
```

#### Resuming sessions

Streamable HTTP supports session resumption. Save the session ID, server capabilities, and server info from the original session, then use <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.McpClient.ResumeSessionAsync*> to reconnect:

```csharp
var transport = new HttpClientTransport(new HttpClientTransportOptions
{
    Endpoint = new Uri("https://my-mcp-server.example.com/mcp"),
    KnownSessionId = previousSessionId
});

await using var client = await McpClient.ResumeSessionAsync(transport, new ResumeClientSessionOptions
{
    ServerCapabilities = previousServerCapabilities,
    ServerInfo = previousServerInfo
});
```

#### Streamable HTTP server (ASP.NET Core)

Use the `ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore` package to host an MCP server over HTTP. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.McpEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapMcp*> method maps the Streamable HTTP endpoint at the specified route (root by default).

```csharp
using ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddMcpServer()
    .WithHttpTransport(options =>
    {
        // Stateless mode is the default and recommended for
        // servers that don't need server-to-client requests.
        options.SessionMode = HttpServerSessionMode.Stateless;
    })
    .WithTools<MyTools>();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapMcp();
app.Run();
```

By default, the HTTP transport runs **statelessly** — the server does not assign an `Mcp-Session-Id` or track transport session state in memory. This simplifies deployment, enables horizontal scaling without session affinity, and matches the `2026-07-28` Streamable HTTP wire format. Set `SessionMode = HttpServerSessionMode.Stateful` explicitly when your server needs stateful sessions for unsolicited notifications, resource subscriptions, or per-client isolation. For a detailed guide on when to use stateless vs. stateful mode, configure session options, and understand [cancellation and disposal](xref:stateless#cancellation-and-disposal) behavior during shutdown, see [Stateless and Stateful](xref:stateless).

#### Host name validation

For local HTTP servers, keep the set of accepted host names limited to loopback values. This helps protect against DNS rebinding, where a browser reaches a local server through an attacker-controlled DNS name while sending that DNS name in the HTTP `Host` header. ASP.NET Core's Kestrel server doesn't validate `Host` headers by default, so configure `AllowedHosts` with known host names rather than `"*"`. This also avoids reflecting untrusted host names through ASP.NET Core features such as absolute URL generation. See [Host filtering with ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/host-filtering) and [URL generation concepts | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#url-generation-concepts).

```json
// appsettings.Development.json
{
  "AllowedHosts": "localhost;127.0.0.1;[::1]"
}
```

For production servers, configure `AllowedHosts` to the exact public host names for the deployment. If Kestrel is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, validate the host name at the layer that receives or forwards the client `Host` header. ASP.NET Core's Host Filtering Middleware is appropriate when Kestrel is public-facing or the `Host` header is directly forwarded; Forwarded Headers Middleware has its own `AllowedHosts` option for cases where the proxy doesn't preserve the original `Host` header. See [Host filtering with ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/host-filtering) and [Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer).

If you intentionally expose the server through another host name, such as a tunnel, container host, reverse proxy, or deployed domain, add that exact host name to `AllowedHosts` instead of using `"*"`.

#### Browser cross-origin access

**Only** enable cross-origin requests (CORS) if you intentionally want browser-based cross-origin access to this server.

CORS is not a substitute for host name validation. When browser-based cross-origin access is required, limit which browser origins can call the MCP endpoint by using the most restrictive ASP.NET Core CORS policy possible. See [Enable Cross-Origin Requests (CORS) in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cors).

For a **stateless** browser client, a narrowly scoped CORS policy usually only needs the headers the browser would otherwise preflight: `Content-Type` for JSON, `Authorization` when the endpoint is protected, and `MCP-Protocol-Version`. If you enable sessions or resumability, also allow `Mcp-Session-Id` and `Last-Event-ID`, and expose `Mcp-Session-Id` on responses so browser code can read it. `Accept` normally doesn't need to be listed because browsers can already send it without extra CORS configuration.

_In the following sample, the MCP server will allow browser calls from `localhost:5173` where a web application is making the request. In production, this allowed origin list would be configured to the trusted web application domains._

```json
// appsettings.Development.json
{
  "Mcp": {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:5173"
    ]
  }
}
```

```csharp
var allowedOrigins = builder.Configuration.GetSection("Mcp:AllowedOrigins").Get<string[]>() ?? ["http://localhost:5173"];

builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("McpBrowserClient", policy =>
    {
        policy.WithOrigins(allowedOrigins)
            // Add `GET` for standalone/resumable SSE streams and DELETE for stateful session termination.
            .WithMethods("POST", "GET", "DELETE")
            .WithHeaders("Content-Type", "Authorization", "MCP-Protocol-Version", "Mcp-Session-Id")
            .WithExposedHeaders("Mcp-Session-Id");
    });
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseCors();
app.MapMcp("/mcp").RequireCors("McpBrowserClient");
```

#### How messages flow

In Streamable HTTP, client requests arrive as HTTP `POST` requests. The server holds each `POST` response body open as an SSE stream and writes the JSON-RPC response — plus any intermediate messages like progress notifications or server-to-client requests — back through it. This provides natural HTTP-level backpressure: each `POST` holds its connection until the handler completes.

In stateful mode, the client can also open a long-lived `GET` request to receive **unsolicited** messages — notifications or server-to-client requests that the server initiates outside any active request handler (for example, resource-changed notifications from a background watcher). In stateless mode, the `GET` endpoint is not mapped, so every message must be part of a `POST` response. For a detailed breakdown, see [How Streamable HTTP delivers messages](xref:stateless#how-streamable-http-delivers-messages).

If your client does not need unsolicited server-to-client messages, or if a long-lived `GET` stream would block other requests under a constrained `HttpClient` connection pool, set <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.HttpClientTransportOptions.EnableStandaloneGetStream> to `false`. Direct responses and streaming responses to client `POST` requests still work; only the standalone `GET` stream is skipped.

A custom route can be specified. For example, the [AspNetCoreMcpPerSessionTools] sample uses a route parameter:

[AspNetCoreMcpPerSessionTools]: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/tree/main/samples/AspNetCoreMcpPerSessionTools

```csharp
app.MapMcp("/mcp");
```

When using a custom route, Streamable HTTP clients should connect directly to that route (for example, `https://host/mcp`), while SSE clients (when [legacy SSE is enabled](xref:stateless#legacy-sse-transport)) should connect to `{route}/sse` (for example, `https://host/mcp/sse`).

For containerized deployments of ASP.NET Core servers, see [Docker deployment](../deployment/docker.md).

### SSE transport (legacy)

The [SSE (Server-Sent Events)] transport is a legacy mechanism that uses unidirectional server-to-client streaming with a separate HTTP endpoint for client-to-server messages. New implementations should prefer Streamable HTTP.

[SSE (Server-Sent Events)]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse

<!-- mlc-disable-next-line -->
> [!NOTE]
> The SSE transport is considered legacy. The [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http-transport) transport is the recommended approach for HTTP-based communication and supports bidirectional streaming.

#### SSE client

Use <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.HttpClientTransport> with <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Client.HttpTransportMode.Sse>:

```csharp
var transport = new HttpClientTransport(new HttpClientTransportOptions
{
    Endpoint = new Uri("https://my-mcp-server.example.com/sse"),
    TransportMode = HttpTransportMode.Sse,
    MaxReconnectionAttempts = 5,
    DefaultReconnectionInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)
});

await using var client = await McpClient.CreateAsync(transport);
```

SSE-specific configuration options:

| Property                      | Description                                                  | Default  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `MaxReconnectionAttempts`     | Maximum number of reconnection attempts on stream disconnect | 5        |
| `DefaultReconnectionInterval` | Wait time between reconnection attempts                      | 1 second |

#### SSE server (ASP.NET Core)

The ASP.NET Core integration supports SSE transport alongside Streamable HTTP. Legacy SSE endpoints (`/sse` and `/message`) are **disabled by default** and <xref:ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore.HttpServerTransportOptions.EnableLegacySse> is marked `[Obsolete]` (diagnostic `MCP9004`). SSE always requires stateful mode; legacy SSE endpoints are never mapped when `SessionMode = HttpServerSessionMode.Stateless`.

**Why SSE is disabled by default.** The SSE transport separates request and response channels: clients `POST` JSON-RPC messages to `/message` and receive all responses through a long-lived `GET` SSE stream on `/sse`. Because the `POST` endpoint returns `202 Accepted` immediately — before the handler even runs — there is **no HTTP-level backpressure** on handler concurrency. A client (or attacker) can flood the server with tool calls without waiting for prior requests to complete. In contrast, Streamable HTTP holds each `POST` response open until the handler finishes, providing natural backpressure. For a detailed comparison and mitigations if you must use SSE, see [Request backpressure](xref:stateless#request-backpressure).

To enable legacy SSE, set `EnableLegacySse` to `true`:

```csharp
using ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddMcpServer()
    .WithHttpTransport(options =>
    {
        // SSE requires stateful mode; opt in explicitly because stateless mode is the default.
        options.SessionMode = HttpServerSessionMode.Stateful;

#pragma warning disable MCP9004 // EnableLegacySse is obsolete
        // Enable legacy SSE endpoints for clients that don't support Streamable HTTP.
        // See sessions doc for backpressure implications.
        options.EnableLegacySse = true;
#pragma warning restore MCP9004
    })
    .WithTools<MyTools>();

var app = builder.Build();

// MapMcp() serves Streamable HTTP. Legacy SSE (/sse and /message) is also
// available because EnableLegacySse is set to true above.
app.MapMcp();
app.Run();
```

See [Stateless and Stateful — Legacy SSE transport](xref:stateless#legacy-sse-transport) for details on SSE session lifetime and configuration.

### Transport mode comparison

| Feature | stdio | Streamable HTTP (stateless) | Streamable HTTP (stateful) | SSE (legacy, stateful) |
|---------|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Process model | Child process | Remote HTTP | Remote HTTP | Remote HTTP |
| Direction | Bidirectional | Request-response | Bidirectional | Server→client stream + client→server `POST` |
| Sessions | Implicit (one per process) | None — each request is independent | `Mcp-Session-Id` tracked in memory | Session ID via query string, tracked in memory |
| Server-to-client requests | ✓ | ✗ (see [MRTR proposal](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/pull/1458)) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Unsolicited notifications | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Backpressure | Implicit (stdin/stdout flow control) | ✓ (POST held open until handler completes) | ✓ (POST held open until handler completes) | ✗ (POST returns 202 immediately — see [backpressure](xref:stateless#request-backpressure)) |
| Session resumption | N/A | N/A | ✓ | ✗ |
| Horizontal scaling | N/A | No constraints | Requires session affinity | Requires session affinity |
| Authentication | Process-level | HTTP auth (OAuth, headers) | HTTP auth (OAuth, headers) | HTTP auth (OAuth, headers) |
| Best for | Local tools, IDE integrations | Remote servers, production deployments | Local HTTP debugging, server-to-client features | Legacy client compatibility |

For a detailed comparison of stateless vs. stateful mode — including deployment trade-offs, security considerations, and configuration — see [Stateless and Stateful](xref:stateless).

### In-memory transport

The <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Server.StreamServerTransport> and <xref:ModelContextProtocol.Protocol.StreamClientTransport> types work with any `Stream`, including in-memory pipes. This is useful for testing, embedding an MCP server in a larger application, or running a client and server in the same process without network overhead.

The following example creates a client and server connected via `System.IO.Pipelines` (from the [InMemoryTransport sample](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/blob/51a4fde4d9cfa12ef9430deef7daeaac36625be8/samples/InMemoryTransport/Program.cs)):

```csharp
using ModelContextProtocol.Client;
using ModelContextProtocol.Protocol;
using ModelContextProtocol.Server;
using System.IO.Pipelines;

Pipe clientToServerPipe = new(), serverToClientPipe = new();

// Create a server using a stream-based transport over an in-memory pipe.
await using McpServer server = McpServer.Create(
    new StreamServerTransport(clientToServerPipe.Reader.AsStream(), serverToClientPipe.Writer.AsStream()),
    new McpServerOptions
    {
        ToolCollection = [McpServerTool.Create((string message) => $"Echo: {message}", new() { Name = "echo" })]
    });
_ = server.RunAsync();

// Connect a client using a stream-based transport over the same in-memory pipe.
await using McpClient client = await McpClient.CreateAsync(
    new StreamClientTransport(clientToServerPipe.Writer.AsStream(), serverToClientPipe.Reader.AsStream()));

// List and invoke tools.
var tools = await client.ListToolsAsync();
var echo = tools.First(t => t.Name == "echo");
Console.WriteLine(await echo.InvokeAsync(new() { ["arg"] = "Hello World" }));
```

Like [stdio](#stdio-transport), the in-memory transport is inherently single-session — there is no `Mcp-Session-Id` header, and server-to-client requests (sampling, elicitation, roots) work naturally over the bidirectional pipe. This makes it ideal for testing servers that depend on these features. For information about how session behavior varies across transports, see [Stateless and Stateful](xref:stateless).

## Cross-application access

The SDK provides built-in support for the [Identity Assertion Authorization Grant (ID-JAG) flow](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth/blob/main/specification/stable/enterprise-managed-authorization.mdx) via `IdentityAssertionGrantProvider`. This enables non-interactive enterprise SSO scenarios where users authenticate once via their enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) and access MCP servers without per-server authorization prompts.

The flow consists of two steps:

1. **RFC 8693 Token Exchange** at the enterprise IdP: OIDC ID token → JWT Authorization Grant (JAG)
2. **RFC 7523 JWT Bearer Grant** at the MCP authorization server: JAG → access token

### Usage

```csharp
using ModelContextProtocol.Authentication;

// The caller owns the HttpClient lifetime.
var httpClient = new HttpClient();

var provider = new IdentityAssertionGrantProvider(
    new IdentityAssertionGrantProviderOptions
    {
        ClientId = "mcp-client-id",
        IdpTokenEndpoint = "https://company.okta.com/oauth2/token",
        IdpClientId = "idp-client-id",
        IdTokenCallback = (context, cancellationToken) =>
            // Fetch a fresh ID token from your SSO session.
            mySsoClient.GetIdTokenAsync(cancellationToken)
    },
    httpClient);

var tokens = await provider.GetAccessTokenAsync(
    resourceUrl: new Uri("https://mcp-server.example.com"),
    authorizationServerUrl: new Uri("https://auth.mcp-server.example.com"),
    cancellationToken: ct);

// Use tokens.AccessToken to authenticate against the MCP server.
// Call provider.InvalidateCache() to force a fresh token exchange on the next call.
```

The provider caches the resulting access token and reuses it until it expires. To force re-authentication (for example, after a 401 response), call `provider.InvalidateCache()` before retrying.
